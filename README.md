# Customer Churn Overview Dashboard

## Overview
This project was part of a guided case study on DataCamp for a fictional telecom company called **Databel**. The goal of the analysis was to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable insights for reducing it. The dashboard was built using **Power BI**.

### Key Metrics
- **Total Churned Customers**: 1,796
- **Total Number of Customers**: 6,687
- **Churn Rate**: 26.86%

## Business Problem
Databel, a telecom company, faces high customer churn, which affects its revenue and growth. The purpose of this dashboard is to:
- Identify the key factors driving customer churn.
- Understand the distribution of churn across customer segments (e.g., contract type, demographics).
- Provide recommendations to improve customer retention.

## Features
1. **Churn Rate by State**:
   - A geographic visualization showing where churn is highest across different states.
2. **Churn by Contract Type**:
   - Breakdown of churn by contract type (month-to-month, one-year, two-year).
3. **Churn by Age**:
   - Visualizes churn rates across different age groups.
4. **Churn Reasons**:
   - A chart listing reasons for churn, including competition, price dissatisfaction, and network reliability.
5. **Grouped Data Consumption**:
   - Analysis of churn rate based on data consumption levels and whether the customer has an unlimited data plan.
6. **Churn by Category**:
   - A donut chart showing the distribution of churn causes, such as competitor offers and product dissatisfaction.

## Insights
- **Contract Type**: Customers on month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate, suggesting that long-term contracts may reduce churn.
- **Churn by Age**: Customers who are 70 or over on average show a much higher churn rate compared customers under 70.
- **Churn Reasons**: The most common reason for churn is competitors offering better deals and products.
- **Geographic Distribution**: California had the highest churn rate of any state by far at 63.24%!
- **Data Plan and Grouped Consumption**: Among customers who used under 5 GB of data, the churn rate of those who have an unlimited data plan was 34.71%, whereas those without a data plan were much lower at 12.31%. In contrast, customers who used more than 5 GB, regardless of whether they had an unlimited plan or not, averaged higher than the total average churn rate.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For interactive data visualization and dashboard creation.
